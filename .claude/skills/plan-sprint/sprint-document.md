# The sprint document

The planning session's terminal artifact, defined once. `/plan-sprint` writes every sprint from this template and never restates it.

`{{SPRINT-DOCUMENT-TEMPLATE}}` is the whole document. Its **How to execute this sprint** and **Completion contract** sections are fixed boilerplate: copy them verbatim into every sprint. The how frames the executor's approach; the contract is the stop condition; sprint certification (`/converge sprint`) discharges the contract. Every executor — `/goal`, an orchestrator, an inline session — works from the same brief.

---

### {{SPRINT-DOCUMENT-TEMPLATE}}

```markdown
# Sprint: <title>

## Intent

<What this sprint is for, in a few sentences. A sprint with no single
theme says so. List the ids of the issues promoted into this sprint,
if any.>

## Corpus deltas

<Authored per {{CORPUS-DELTA-FORM}} in `artifact-definitions.md`.
Each delta sits under a heading naming the operation and target:>

### New story: <slug>
### Amend concept: <slug>
### Retire decision: <slug>
### New docspec: <slug>
### Amend surface intent

<Every delta is a complete final-form body. New artifacts and
amendments carry the whole file content; a retirement carries only
its heading. Large bodies go in the sidecar folder beside this file
(`<sprint-name>-deltas/<kind>s/<slug>.md`, a docspec at
`<sprint-name>-deltas/docspecs/<slug>.md`, the surface intent at
`<sprint-name>-deltas/surface/surface.md`), the heading pointing
there. No delta carries a diff, a base pin, or a derivation.>

## Work items

<The implementation units that realize the deltas: a flat, unordered
list. Each names the stories and decisions it makes true (by slug)
and describes the outcome, not the method. Each changes the product:
its code, configuration, documents, or design corpus. An item that
consists of using what the sprint builds is reshaped into the
feature, script, or seed asset that lets a user reach the outcome.
State real dependencies between items. Sequencing is the executor's
job.>

## Paths outside the project root

<Only where a work item changes files outside the project root: one
line per folder, a bullet holding the path relative to the project
root in backticks, such as:>

- `../runtime`

<Omit the section when every work item stays inside the project root.
Sprint certification reviews, checks, and fixes the files under each
listed path beside the files under the project root.>

## Implementation notes

<Written by the planning session's code planning, in the form
{{IMPLEMENTATION-NOTES-FORM}} in `.claude/skills/plan-sprint/core.md`:
the commit the notes were planned against, then per work item the
code changes, the improvements the sprint takes, and every behavior
change with its users and ruling.>

## How to execute this sprint

This sprint is self-sufficient. Every executor — an inline session,
an agent handed this file via `/goal`, an orchestrator with its own
planning — runs the same shape: record the base commit, plan the work
into the task tracker as small build tasks cut from the
implementation notes, drain them, then run sprint certification once.
No review runs during the build.

1. Read the sprint whole first: intent, deltas, work items,
   implementation notes, completion contract. The sprint is the whole
   brief: context from the intake (`.ok-planner/issues.jsonl`) or
   `history/` may disagree with what the owner approved. Raise a gap
   with the owner. Where `/goal` handed you this file, its checker is
   a separate model that reads only the session: it opens no file and
   runs no command. State its stop condition in your first message,
   in these words: "This goal is met when `.ok-planner/bin/review
   certified --sprint <this sprint's path>` prints `SPRINT COMPLETE`
   in this session. Archiving and committing are the owner's acts,
   not goal terms."

2. Record the base. Sprint certification reads the change from this
   commit, so the tree holds nothing but this sprint's work from here
   on. The planning session leaves its own files uncommitted: this
   file, its delta sidecar, `.ok-planner/release-boundaries.md`, the
   intake's two files (`.ok-planner/issues.jsonl` and
   `.ok-planner/history/issues.jsonl`), and the sketches it archived. Where `git
   status --porcelain` lists a path outside `.ok-planner/`, name those
   paths to the owner and stop, because certification would count
   them as this sprint's work. Otherwise write the output of `git
   rev-parse HEAD` to the file beside this sprint with the same
   filename, `-base` before the extension and `.txt` as the
   extension.

3. Open the run. The task tracker at `.ok-planner/bin/tasks` and the
   profiles under `.claude/agents/` are required; a missing one is
   the front door's administration (`/ok`) to materialize: say so and
   stop. `tasks init <sprint-name> --file
   .ok-planner/sprints/<sprint-name>-run.jsonl`, `tasks agent
   register ok-opus`, and register the `build` prompt: write
   `{{SPRINT-BUILD-PROMPT}}` from `.claude/skills/_sprint/shared.md`,
   its transclusions resolved and `[SPRINT PATH]` filled, to
   `.ok-planner/sprints/<sprint-name>-build.md`, then `tasks prompt
   register build <that path>`. Declare the roles whose close carries
   a sweep: `tasks config set swept_roles '["build", "fix"]'`, so a
   build task closes `done` only with the sites its searches
   returned, each one staged.

4. Plan the work into stages from the implementation notes. Read the
   code each work item's notes name, in the tree as it stands now,
   before you file anything. Where the tree has moved since the
   notes' commit and a named site no longer matches, plan from the
   outcome the notes state and record the difference as a divergence
   call. Cut the sprint into stages, each **the smallest change that
   makes progress toward the completion contract and leaves the tree
   runnable**: it builds, nothing is half-wired, and the work after it
   can build on it. A stage lands one work item or a part of one. A
   work item that needs more than one agent's reading set becomes
   several stages in sequence. A taken improvement lands in the same
   stage as the change to its definition. Per stage, file one build
   task: `tasks file --role build --prompt build --agent ok-opus
   --key <stage> --files <the paths it may edit> --cites <the work
   items and slugs> --after <the build tasks of the stages it builds
   on, omitted where it builds on none> --brief "<the work items it
   lands, the improvements and deltas it applies, the behavior
   changes it carries by id with their rulings, and where the code
   is and what to reuse>"`. Two stages whose files overlap are
   chained with `--after`; a stage that applies a delta reaches its
   collection's catalog TOC too (`.ok-planner/design/concepts.md`,
   `stories.md`, or `decisions.md`, `.ok-planner/subjects.md` or
   `.ok-planner/practices.md`, or the docspec index
   `.ok-planner/docspec.md`, every one of which
   `python3 .ok-planner/bin/catalog-toc` regenerates), so two
   delta-bearing stages overlap. Stages with disjoint files run together. Apply a
   delta no work item implements in a stage of its own.

5. Render the completion report with the staged list before the first
   drain: write the output of `tasks render --title "<this sprint's
   title>" --sprint <this sprint's path>` to the report file (step
   10).

6. Keep the progress checklist. Where the harness task tools are
   available, mirror the stages as a live checklist. Create one entry
   per stage when the build tasks are filed. Mark an entry in progress
   when its build task is dispatched, and done when that task closes
   `done`. Add one entry for sprint certification when the drain ends.
   The run file is the record and the checklist is display.

7. Drain with the loop at `.claude/skills/_tasks/drain.md`.
   A build that closes `partial` is refiled for its remainder with
   `tasks refile <task>`; one that closes `partial` with a result
   starting `outside files:` is refiled with that path added to its
   files. A build that closes `blocked` is refiled once. The session
   builds nothing and reviews nothing itself, and edits no file a
   running task owns.

8. Every stage applies its corpus deltas as part of the work that
   realizes them, and every new or amended story implemented in code
   carries the `@story:` annotation at the site that realizes it. The
   build prompt carries both rules.

9. Uncommitted work is the only record of the run. Every task stages
   the paths it touched as it closes (`git add <paths>`), and the run
   records them. Never run `git checkout`/`restore`/`reset`/`stash`/
   `clean` on your own initiative. Fix a bad edit forward by editing
   again.

10. The completion report lives beside this sprint file, same
    filename with `-completion` before the extension. The session
    re-renders it whole from the run before every dispatch: `##
    Stages` from the build tasks and `## Calls` from the run's
    `divergences` pool, one row per call an agent made without the
    owner. Build tasks record calls, forks, what they noticed, and
    the improvements they landed as items; the report is rendered,
    never hand-edited.

11. Work unsupervised to a defensible done. Do not pause for
    approval, confirmation, or progress checks. Execution and sprint
    certification need no owner action: file no task for the owner to
    perform. The archive and the commit after completion stay the
    owner's one act. Stop only on a genuine blocker: a credential or
    access you cannot obtain, a step impossible in the current state,
    a destructive or irreversible action not clearly authorized, a
    task closed `blocked` twice, or sprint certification being
    unrunnable for you. Surface that and stop. Ambiguity is not a blocker: the builder makes the most
    plausible call and records it, or records a fork and builds the
    reading it judges best. Sprint certification reads both.

12. Code complete means every stage's latest build task closed
    `done`. Then run sprint certification, immediately after:
    `/converge sprint <this sprint's path>`. It judges the change
    from the commit in the `-base.txt` file to the working tree,
    once, against this sprint: every outcome and taken improvement
    works, a user gets what every story promises when a driver uses
    the running product, every delta landed, every ruling holds, no
    unlisted behavior change breaks a user, and the project's checks
    pass. It fixes each defect in the sprint's scope, a drive failure
    the sprint's change caused among them, and verifies each fix on
    its own diff. A drive failure in code the change did not reach,
    and any other defect outside the sprint's scope, goes to the
    intake as a `category: defect` issue for the next `/converge`,
    and a question only the owner can decide goes to the intake for
    the next `/plan-sprint`.
    It ends by presenting its return block.

13. Re-render the completion report whole with the certification's
    calls: write the output of `tasks --file
    .ok-planner/sprints/<sprint-name>-run.jsonl render --title
    "<this sprint's title>" --sprint <this sprint's path>
    --certification <the /converge run's ledger>` to the report
    file. `--file` names this sprint's run, because `/converge`
    moved the tracker's pointer to its own ledger. Then write the
    return block into the completion report, after its rendered
    sections, under a `# Sprint certification` heading, with the
    `/converge` run's ledger path. Nothing renders the report after
    this. Then run `.ok-planner/bin/review certified --sprint <this
    sprint's path>` and show its output whole. It checks items 1 to 3
    of the completion contract against the repository, and prints
    `SPRINT COMPLETE`, or `SPRINT NOT COMPLETE` with each failure.
    Where it prints `SPRINT NOT COMPLETE`, name each failure to the
    owner and stop: it is a genuine blocker under step 11. Then
    present the completion report's `## Calls` table to
    the owner, and ask which rows, if any, the owner vetoes. For each
    vetoed row, file one issue with `.ok-planner/bin/issues file
    --from -`, in the format of the `{{ISSUE-FILE-FORMAT}}` block of
    `.claude/skills/_shared/artifact-definitions.md`: kind `human`,
    category `product-intent`, its problem the row. Then record the
    owner's words as that issue's ruling with `.ok-planner/bin/issues
    rule <id> --text -`, the words on stdin, so the next
    `/plan-sprint` pulls the veto in as the owner's decision. `issues
    rule` signs the ruling with the name of the person running the
    session; where it refuses for want of a name, relay the refusal's
    setting text to the owner and record the ruling once a name
    resolves. Then offer the archive and the commit below as one
    owner act. Walk nothing else with the
    owner: every defect the run could not fix and every question it
    raised is already in the intake, for the next `/converge` or
    `/plan-sprint`.

**The archive and the commit.** The owner archives this sprint and
commits the work; offer both as one owner act, and wait. "Finish the
sprint" and "follow the boilerplate" are not a yes; both ask for the
presentation. On the owner's yes:

1. Close each issue this sprint promoted: for each id that
   `.ok-planner/bin/issues list --sprint <this file's name>` prints,
   run `.ok-planner/bin/issues close <id> --as promoted`, which moves
   its record to `.ok-planner/history/issues.jsonl`.
2. Move this file, its completion report, its run file, its
   `-base.txt` file, its `-build.md` prompt, and its delta sidecar to
   `.ok-planner/history/sprints/`: `git mv` for a tracked file, `mv`
   for an untracked one.
3. Stage by name every path the sprint's change touched, every moved
   file at its new path, the `/converge` run's ledger and folder, and
   the intake's two files, `.ok-planner/issues.jsonl` and
   `.ok-planner/history/issues.jsonl`. Commit those paths alone
   with `git commit -- <paths>`, naming only paths that exist or that
   `git mv` removed, so nothing else standing in the index rides
   along.
4. Add `closed: <the commit's sha>` to the archived sprint as YAML
   frontmatter, and commit that edit alone. The next planning
   session reads that stamp to detect work done out of band.

The owner publishes; the run never pushes.

## Completion contract

The work is done when all of the following hold, each verifiable
from the repository as it stands:

1. Every corpus matches every delta above, applied verbatim (from
   the sidecar where a heading points there): `.ok-planner/design/`
   for a concept, story, or decision, `.ok-planner/subjects/` or
   `.ok-planner/practices/` for a subject or practice, and
   `.ok-planner/docspec/` for a docspec, each with its catalog TOC
   regenerated, the docspec index `.ok-planner/docspec.md` among
   them; and `.ok-planner/surface/surface.md` for the surface
   intent.
2. The project builds, and the checks `.ok-planner/review/config.json`
   lists under `checks` pass on every file the change touched, or fail
   only where sprint certification's return lists the failure as a
   `stuck` defect.
3. The completion report beside this sprint (same filename with
   `-completion`) carries the return block of sprint certification
   (`/converge sprint`) run on this sprint, under `# Sprint certification`: the run's find
   loop ran once, and every defect stands `verified`, `declined`,
   `duplicate`, or `stuck`, with every `stuck` defect listed for the
   owner.

**The goal rule, for any checker verifying this contract.** The goal
is met when items 1–3 verify against the repository as it stands.
`.ok-planner/bin/review certified --sprint <this sprint's path>`
checks them there and prints `SPRINT COMPLETE` or `SPRINT NOT
COMPLETE`. A checker that reads only the session, as `/goal`'s does,
decides from that command's latest output in the session; a checker
that runs commands runs it. A `stuck` defect listed in the
return, a check that still fails among them, is the owner's to take
up, and holds no term of the contract open.
Presenting the report, archiving, committing, and the
`closed:` stamp all follow completion, and none is a term of the
goal. `sprints/` and
`.ok-planner/history/sprints/` satisfy the rule alike, and a sprint
already archived with a `closed:` stamp is terminal. A missing
completion report, or one without the return block,
means not done. Nothing else counts either way.
