# This project, for the review loop

Agents keep this file current: a sprint build that adds or changes a script input updates it in the same stage, and a `/converge` fixer fixes a clear defect in it. The limits under "What no agent of this loop ever runs" bind every agent. The review loop pastes the file into every prompt that reads or runs the tree. It holds the facts a general loop cannot know.

## The root and what is out of scope

The project root is the ok-plugins monorepo root, the folder that holds `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`. The shipped product is `plugins/` (`plugins/ok`, `plugins/ok-conduct`, `plugins/ok-web`) and the ok-planner family the front door carries at `plugins/ok/families/ok-planner/`. No agent edits the suite-owned files of the vendored suite layer this repo dogfoods: each file under `.claude/skills/`, `.claude/agents/`, `.claude/hooks/`, and `.claude/rules/` that carries the suite's `Materialized by ok-` stamp or is a suite `LICENSE`, `.claude/rules/ok-concepts.md`, and the materialized files under `.ok-planner/`; only `/ok` rewrites them. The project's own files under `.claude/`, such as `.claude/skills/release/`, are in the run like any other file the project owns. No agent reads `.ok-planner/sprints/`, `.ok-planner/sketches/`, `.ok-planner/documentation/`, or `.ok-planner/history/` unless a skill directs it. A sprint lists no folders outside the root.

## What no agent of this loop ever runs

- `/release` (`.claude/skills/release/`): it commits, tags, and pushes to `origin`.
- `git push`, and any `git tag` pushed to `origin`.
- `claude plugin update`, `claude plugin install`, and `claude plugin marketplace update`: they change the operator's own installed plugins.
- `/ok`: it rewrites the vendored suite layer and `.claude/settings.json`, and stays an owner act.
- The converge core at `plugins/ok/families/ok-planner/admin/converge`, run at the project root: it rewrites the vendored suite layer and the estate this repository dogfoods. A driver runs it only against a scratch project, as "Resources a driver starts" says.

## The helpers the catalogs name

The tree has no event emitter, no atomic-replace helper, and no practice that governs owner frames.

## Code rules

- `.claude/rules/plumbline-cheatsheet.md`
- `.claude/rules/plumbline-coding.md`

## Scripts for developers and operators

- `checks/run`: takes no inputs; runs every check under `checks/` with `python3` and exits non-zero when one fails.
- `checks/token-resolution`, `checks/ceremony-surfaces`, `checks/materialized-standalone`, `checks/vendored-layer`, `checks/owned-paths`, `checks/oscillation`: each takes no inputs and is run by `checks/run`.
- `plugins/ok/families/ok-planner/admin/converge`: takes a mode (`diagnose`, none for converge, `resolve <id> [choice] [--from <draft>]`, `amend <config path> --from <draft>` with the config path `.ok-planner/config.json` or `.ok-planner/review/config.json`, `wire-hooks <group>` with the group `session-start`, `subagents`, or `lint`, and `wire-env`).
- `plugins/ok/families/ok-planner/scripts/tasks` and `plugins/ok/families/ok-planner/scripts/review`: the task tracker and the review tool, each taking a subcommand. The tracker's `item add --from <path|->` reads JSON Lines, one item per line with `body` and `fields` and optionally `fingerprint` and `state`, and adds every item in one write or none.
- `plugins/ok/families/ok-planner/scripts/issues`: the intake module, taking a subcommand. `file`, `revise <id>`, `respond <id>`, and `import` each read one JSON object (records, for `import`) from `--from <path|->`, and `import` also takes `--over-event-log`, `--over-archived-event-log`, and `--dry-run`, which checks the import under the lock, prints what it would write, and writes nothing. `revise <id>`'s object may also carry `by` (`triage-issues` or `converge`) and `text`, one line saying what changed, and needs both on a routed or ruled issue unless the change is link-only. `close <id>` takes `--from <path|->`, or `--as`, `--reason`, and `--fixed-by` in its place. `rule <id>` and `comment <id>` take `--text <text|->`. `edit <id> <n> --text <text|->` rewrites, and `remove <id> <n>` removes, the owner's own message number `n`. `unrule <id>` withdraws the owner's ruling. `flag <id>` and `unflag <id>` set and clear the discussion flag. `read <id> [--opened <time>]` marks every agent message read. `promote <id> --sprint <file>` stamps a sprint. `linked <id>` records that triage checked an issue's links. The readers are `list` (`--state`, `--category`, `--artifact`, `--sprint`, `--waiting`, `--unread`, `--flagged`, `--json`), `show <id> [--opened <time>] [--json]`, `links` (`--broken`, `--pending`, `--json`), and `history [--json]`. `--opened` names one record among several closed records under the same id, by its opened time. It works on the estate of the nearest ancestor of the working directory holding `.ok-planner/`, or the one `OK_PLANNER_PROJECT_ROOT` names.
- `plugins/ok/families/ok-planner/scripts/dashboard`: the dashboard's service, taking `--port <n>` (0 to 65535; the default, 0, lets the OS assign one) and `--open` (opens the page in the default browser once the service listens). It finds the estate as `issues` does, serves `.ok-planner/dashboard/` and its JSON routes on `127.0.0.1` until SIGTERM or Ctrl-C, and takes HTTP input:
  - `GET /api/meta`; `GET /api/issues` (query `state`, `category`, `waiting=1`, `unread=1`); `GET /api/closed` (query `category`); `GET /api/issue/<id>` (query `opened`); `GET /api/file` (query `path`, a path relative to the project root; it refuses a path outside the root, under `.git`, or one git ignores).
  - `POST /api/issue/<id>/rule` and `/comment`, each with a JSON body `{"text": ...}`; `POST /api/issue/<id>/read` (query `opened`); `POST /api/issue/<id>/unrule`, `/flag`, and `/unflag`; `POST /api/issue/<id>/message/<n>/edit` with a JSON body `{"text": ...}`, and `POST /api/issue/<id>/message/<n>/remove`.
  - Every request carries a `Host` of `127.0.0.1:<port>` or `localhost:<port>`, and every POST `Content-Type: application/json`.
- `plugins/ok/families/ok-planner/scripts/plumbline`: takes a path to lint, or a subcommand (`patterns`, `config-check`, `version`).
- `plugins/ok/families/ok-planner/scripts/catalog-toc`, `plugins/ok/families/ok-planner/scripts/run-tag`, and `plugins/ok/families/ok-planner/scripts/port-block`: the catalog TOC generator (a project root, or `--check`), the run tag minter (no inputs), and the port readback (a run tag).

## Drive commands

- No stack: the product runs inside a Claude Code session; its stories are offered through skills, which drivers review, and through the converge core and the materialized scripts, which drivers run against a scratch project.
- The dashboard: make a scratch project as "Resources a driver starts" says and converge it with the converge core, so it holds `.ok-planner/bin/dashboard`, `.ok-planner/bin/issues`, and the placed build at `.ok-planner/dashboard/`. Seed the intake with `.ok-planner/bin/issues file --from -`, one JSON object per issue, run from the scratch project. Start the service from the scratch project in the background with `python3 .ok-planner/bin/dashboard`; it prints `dashboard: serving http://127.0.0.1:<port>/ (pid <pid>)`. Drive the page at that address, or its JSON routes with `curl`, sending `Content-Type: application/json` on every POST. Stop it with `kill <pid>`, the pid that line names, before deleting the folder.

## Running the product, for the drive

The product has no stack to start or stop. It runs inside a Claude Code session: the primary user surface is the slash commands the plugins and the vendored skills offer (`/ok`, `/plan-sprint`, `/converge`, `/audit`, and the rest). The other surfaces are the converge core's command line, the materialized scripts (`.ok-planner/bin/tasks`, `.ok-planner/bin/issues`, `.ok-planner/bin/plumbline`, `.ok-planner/bin/run-tag`, `.ok-planner/bin/port-block`), the dashboard's service at `.ok-planner/bin/dashboard`, which serves a page on loopback while a driver runs it, and the hooks the plugins and the vendored layer wire. No surface signs a user in.

A driver reviewing a skill surface reads the skill's source under `plugins/`, never the materialized copy under `.claude/skills/`.

## Resources a driver starts

A driver that needs a consumer project makes a scratch folder with `mktemp -d`, runs `git init` in it, drives the converge core at `plugins/ok/families/ok-planner/admin/converge` against it, and deletes the folder when done.
